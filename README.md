Radiologists can spend up to eight hours a day rapidly interpreting different CT, X-Ray and MRI scans every three to four seconds. These expeditious observations of various visual stimuli may cause a misguided percept of tumors and other objects––a direct consequence of a visual phenomenon known as serial dependence. Serial dependence, or the correlation of a person’s current percept of a visual stimulus to the perception of a different stimulus in the past (memory bias), is likely a significant cause of the 33% error rate that radiologists experience when evaluating whether or not tumors are benign or malignant. Past research, however, has failed to address whether serial dependence is indeed the root cause, or if this error is caused by cognitive functions such as cognitive anchoring. Consequently, this experiment was designed to verify how the visual percept of tumors is affected by serial dependence, as well as analyzing classification, detection, localization, and search time results to determine the extent of spatial location and object biases. Based on previous literature, it was predicted that test subjects would be biased by stimuli displayed within brief temporal separation periods, thus laying the groundwork to analyze exactly how this bias arises. Our results indicated that the effect of serial dependence applies to all facets of tumor analysis (i.e. classification, localization and search times), except for a binary mode of detection.
